      <description>Trained By Ruth Franklin This site would not be possible without the generosity of Bonnie Williams and her 40 years of dedicated work in the embroidery industry. Bonnie met Ruth Franklin in 1979 and spent time learning to operate the Singer 114w103 bonnaz machine under Ruth&amp;rsquo;s supervision. A full machine dissasembly, hours of embroidering squares to learn how to get sharp corners, Ruth ensured that Bonnie would become a skilled operator.</description>
