      <description>Ruth Franklin covers everything from machine operation, troubleshooting machine problems, industry professionalism to pricing embroidery work. Every page contains details regarding bonnaz embroidery and comes with the authority and experience of a 40+ year veteran. It is highly recommended that all chain stitch operators have a printed copy of this book to reference.
Extra effort was taken when digitizing the original documents to allow for searchable keywords and phrase matches. For example searching for Cornely looper timing or inconsistent stitch issues can be found with &amp;ldquo;looper&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;timing&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Trained By Ruth Franklin This site would not be possible without the generosity of Bonnie Williams and her 40 years of dedicated work in the embroidery industry. Bonnie met Ruth Franklin in 1979 and spent time learning to operate the Singer 114w103 bonnaz machine under Ruth&amp;rsquo;s supervision. A full machine disassembly, hours of embroidering squares to learn how to get sharp corners, Ruth ensured that Bonnie would become a skilled operator.</description>
