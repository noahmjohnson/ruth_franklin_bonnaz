      <description>Ruth Franklin covers everything from machine operation, troubleshooting machine problems, industry professionalism to pricing embroidery work. Every page contains details regarding bonnaz embroidery and comes with the authority and experience of a 40+ year veteran. It is highly recommended that all chain stitch operators have a printed copy of this book to reference.
